## Project 1
The principle of this algorithm is to "think" that the square root of a number has the property of being the number to 
the power of 2, hence the _floored squared root_ is given __when the floored divion result is the same as the divisor__.

### Time complexity:
In this case time complexity is __O(log(n))__, as we transverse all integer number till finding n (being _s_ the 
number of times this is done); using the formula __sÂ² = n__ , which is equivalent to __log(n)=s__
